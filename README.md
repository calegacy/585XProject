# Building an app for statistics education concepts.

This Shiny App can be used in introductory statistics lectures or labs to help aid with conceptual ideas.

In order to use the app, you can download the BuildStatEdShiny.R file and run the code in R studio. 
The app should appear and be ready to use immediately. All you will have to do is click on what topics you are interested in, and the corresponding tabs will appear in the main panel.

The paper 585XProject_LegacyChelsey.pdf can be downloaded and read for more information on the background of the project.
